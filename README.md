# SharpNeruon

SharpNeuron is a .NET Neural Network library based on [NeronDotNet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/neurondotnet/), which seems to have been abandoned.

## About this project

The core of SharpNeuron (NeuronDotNet) has been left mostly intact, though specific changes have been made to make it more customizable.
One of the major goals of this project is to provide high-level APIs for specialized purposes to improve usability and simplicity.

## Using SharpNeuron

Simply clone the source and add the `SharpNeuron` project to your solution. This will allow you to customize it in case you would like to, and allows you to avoid using any precompiled libraries.

SharpNeuron has no platform-specific limitations, and should work on any .NET platform.
